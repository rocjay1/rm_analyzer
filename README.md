# rm_analyzer

## Description

Generates a summary email of a Rocket Money transactions export. Helps two people evenly split monthly expenses. 

**Notes**
- The main project and CI/CD is hosted at GitLab. The project is push-mirrored to GitHub.
- Gmail is implemented with OAuth2: [Python quickstart](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python). `send.py` is based on [Sending Email](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/sending).
- PyInstaller is used to create the executable. [Using PyInstaller to Easily Distribute Python Applications](https://realpython.com/pyinstaller-python/#using-pyinstaller) is a fantastic resource.
- To build the Windows executable, a build pipeline triggers PyInstaller to run on a Windows Server VM and captures the executable as an artifact. See [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and [Hosted runners on Windows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/hosted_runners/windows.html).
